### The right order to build the backend

**Step 1: Project setup & Docker environment** (Foundation)
- Create minimal folder structure for one service
- Write `docker-compose.yml` with Postgres, Redis, and Rspamd
- Verify all containers start and can talk to each other
- **Why first?** You need a working environment to test everything else.[1][2]

**Step 2: Database models & migrations** (Data layer)
- Define SQLAlchemy models for `messages`, `verdicts`, `features`
- Write initial Alembic migration
- Test CRUD operations work
- **Why second?** Everything else stores data here; get the schema right early.[3][4]

**Step 3: Basic FastAPI skeleton** (API layer)
- Create FastAPI app with health endpoint
- Add database connection with dependency injection
- Add basic config management (environment variables)
- Test the `/health` endpoint returns DB status
- **Why third?** This is your framework; other modules plug into it.[5][3]

**Step 4: Email parsing utilities** (Core logic)
- Build MIME parser that extracts headers, body, attachments
- Build URL extractor and basic header analyzer
- Write comprehensive unit tests with sample .eml files
- **Why fourth?** This is reusable pure logic with no external dependencies—easy to test in isolation.[6][3]

**Step 5: Rspamd integration** (External integration)
- Build Rspamd HTTP client
- Parse check responses and symbol hits
- Integration test with real Rspamd container
- **Why fifth?** Now you have parsed emails to send to Rspamd for scoring.[7][8]

**Step 6: Analysis pipeline** (Business logic)
- Combine parsing + Rspamd + basic scoring rules
- Write a simple "analyze one email" function
- Test end-to-end: raw email → parsed → Rspamd scan → verdict in DB
- **Why sixth?** This is your core value—proves the concept works.[2][4]

**Step 7: Task queue & workers** (Async processing)
- Add Celery/ARQ for background jobs
- Create "analyze email" task
- Test queueing and execution
- **Why seventh?** Once core logic works synchronously, make it async for scale.[9][10]

**Step 8: Ingestion (Gmail/IMAP)** (Data sources)
- Build Gmail API client with OAuth
- Build IMAP client
- Queue analysis tasks for fetched emails
- **Why eighth?** Now you can actually pull real emails into the system.[11][12]

**Step 9: REST API endpoints** (User interface)
- GET /messages, GET /messages/{id}, POST /actions/quarantine
- Wire up to database and workers
- **Why ninth?** Frontend can now consume your backend.[3][5]

**Step 10: Dashboard (React)** (Frontend)
- Build after backend is stable
- **Why last?** No point building UI until data flows work.[13][14]

### So start with Step 1: Docker environment

**What I recommend building RIGHT NOW:**

1. Minimal folder structure (just what we need for Steps 1-3)
2. `docker-compose.yml` with Postgres, Redis, Rspamd
3. A simple script to verify all containers start
